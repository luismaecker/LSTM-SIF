# Final Modelling {#-src-model} 

This script runs the model again using the local non auto regressive model, as this was the best performing setup.
The Grid search is done on a reduced Hyperparameter grid, based on the prelimnary analysis. 

The information on the modelling functions used in this script can be found [here](#sec-mod_funcs).
