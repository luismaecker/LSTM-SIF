# Prelimnary Modelling {#-src_prelim}

This script will create 4  basic types of models, which are differing whether they are trained global or local models and whether they have an auto regressive component or not. 

To find the best hyperparameters 3 look back periods are tested and a grid search cross-validation is done. 

The information on the modelling functions used in this script can be found [here](#sec-mod_funcs).
