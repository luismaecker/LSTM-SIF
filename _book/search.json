    "text": "Outline\nThis is the quarto book for the project “Forecasting Solar Induced Fluorescence for German Forest after the Heatwave in 2018 using Deep Learning”. This project was created as part of two course projects in the “Earth System Data Science and Remote Sensing” Master at Leipzig University. The courses are Scientific Writing by Prof. Dr. Miguel Mahecha and Spatio-temporal Data by Dr. Guido Kraemer. This quarto book contains all code used for the analysis, shows the main results and briefly discusses them, as well as a Data Management Plan. The project is fully reproducible and all data is openly available. The project can be found at this Gitlab repository."

    "section": "Motivation",
    "text": "Motivation\nGerman Forest have faced a strong dieback in the last years. Climate extremes like the Heatwave in 2018 are regarded as one of the major drivers for this process. Remote Sensing data can be used to effectively estimate vegetation variables over large areas. While most commonly spectral indices like the NDVI are applied, plant traits like the sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) provide a more direct link to the physiological processes in vegetation. SIF is linked to photosynthetic activity and it reacts near-instantaneously to changes in the environment e.g. light or temperature. So far there is a lack of reliable forecasts of vegetation variables for German forests under varying climatic conditions. Particularly for extreme weather events forecasts were so far not successful. Sucessfully modelling SIF using climatic predictors, would allow us to asses the impact of potential future climate changes on the photosynthetic activity of forests and their role in the carbon cycle."
